Description: The R package `mpoxnetwork` implements a two-level epidemic model that 
    explicitly incorporates both sexual and non-sexual transmission routes. 
    The model is flexible, age-structured, and built around a sexual contact network 
    informed by power-law degree distributions. The package supports simulation of epidemics, 
    projection of reproduction numbers by mode of transmission, final epidemic sizes, 
    and the age- and mode-specific contributions to transmission over time. Detailed 
    methodology is provided in the manuscript.
